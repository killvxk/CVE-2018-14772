# CVE-2018-14772

yeee buddy, new RCE

### info

This is a PoC for CVE-2018-14772 that I discovered in the [pydio](https://pydio.com/) 
file sharing platform. The PoC exploits a post-authentication remote code 
execution vulnerability. It requires administrative credentials to work. You 
can run the exploit like so:

```
$ python exploit.py -t TARGET-URI -p PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
```

for example:

```
$ python exploit.py -t http://192.168.56.103/pydio/ -u coastal -p hunter2
```

make sure you have a netcat listener up on `31337` (or whatever, change the source).
